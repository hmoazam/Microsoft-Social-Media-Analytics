# Microsoft Social Media Analytics Accelerator

Social media analytics is an extremely popular topic as businesses, governments, event planners and others seek insights into people's comments and opinions. There is a plethora of data available from various sources such as social media posts, news articles, and more. This repository contains a proof of concept (PoC) implementation for an end-to-end social media listening and visualization system, built with the Microsoft Azure cloud. It is meant to serve as a quick-start to showcase the insights that can be derived from social media listening. It is not meant to serve as a production level solution, but a starting point towards one. We have provided some guidance for extending the solution, however it can be customized and extended in multiple different ways.
